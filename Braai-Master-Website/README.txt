This is a solo project I did for a Web Development module. 

The instruction was to create a website for a local community, with their permission of course. 

At the time, I was heavily into playing Destiny 2 with the homies from a local Discord channel, so I reached out to see if they would
mind me using some of their content to make a website.After some consideration, they provided me with permission. Once they saw the final product, 
they were super stoked. 

I also asked them if they would mind sharing some in-game captures (like screenshots) that they feel best represent their group,
and they provided abundantly.

This project was developed entirely with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. No framework was used. I sourced all filler images and gifs from various sources, but none of them are mine.  All the images in the gallery are those provided by the Discord Community.
