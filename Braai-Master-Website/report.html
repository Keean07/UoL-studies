<h2>Introduction:</h2><br><br>

<p>
    The website I have created is a point of leverage for a local gaming community called the "BraaiMasters". Through this community, I've met awesome strangers that I now consider friends, I've been shown how to do things that I previously never knew, and I've gotten the opportunity to play content that was always out of my reach as a lone gamer. To me, the experience of being a contributing member of a community has been great, this is an experience I wanted to invite all online gamers to have.<br><br>

    Through being a member of the server, I've observed the tone of newcomers - some people are dripping with excitement, whilst others are understandably nervous to be interacting with such a large community. Whether they are excited or nervous, their reasons for joining are often similar - they want help or guidance in completing challenging content, and they want companionship. This opened my eyes to the fact there there are likely a handful of people who refrain from joining a local community out of fear of the unknown.<br><br>

    I figured that to create a comforting "Welcome Site" for all newcommers, where they can get a feel of what to expect when joining the server, would be a good starting point for me. It will motivate them to join, and reassure them that they will be fully accepted regardless of who they are. This is important to me, because I feel that everyone who enjoys delving into a virtual world, deserves to share that enjoyment with their local community.<br><br>

    My site structure reflects an Invitation, in that, the directory order goes: Index.html, OurOffering.html, Gallery.html, FAQs.html, JoinUs.html.<br><br>

    - Index.html : provides a landing body where newcommers will be met with a themed explanation as to what the community is about.<br><br>

    - OurOffering.html : contains content that reflects what the server offers to each member.<br><br>

    - Gallery.html : showcases numerous in-game screenshots taken by members of the communities, some of which are priceless, anhd is why they will forever be honored in the "Hall of Fame".<br><br>

    - FAQs.html : provides a means for the user to browse topical information that is commonly requested by users, and ask questions. It also contains links to external social media sites and a motivational message to the newcommers.<br><br>

    - JoinUs.html : Includes embedded videos from social media that are "in the act" footage of some shenanigans from the community. It also includes a "What to expect" section that has a brief description of what to expect when landing on the server, as well as a Discord Widget that displays which members are online, and provides a link directly to the server. <br><br>
</p>
<h2>Inspiraition: </h2><br><br>
<p>
    I was inspired by the kindness and hospitality that the community members showed me when I first joined them. As an individual who has never been a part of a large-scale community, they were everything I could have ever hoped for.<br><br>

    I realized that their community was worthy of the limelight after seeing multiple members share their creative works in the "Arts Club" discussion forum. These artworks ranged from graphic design work, paintings, digital artworks, replica crafting and much more. Unfortunately I could not receive consent to use any of these artworks in my site, but they did inspire me to create a platform through which outsiders could see what the members of the community create.<br><br>

    Inspiration was also drawn from my mid-term groupwork assignment. In my opinion, the HTML struture for the website was superb and had a distinct sense of flow to the content - this was something I wanted to include in my website too. I feel that the CSS color scheme used for that website conveyed the information in a clear and concise manner, allowing users to easily absord what was being presented to them - this was also something that I wanted to include.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Accessibility : </h2><br><br>

<p>
    To ensure that a vast majority of people with different capabilities can use my website, I included some accessiblity features.<br><br>

    1. I integrated the options to change the text font size on screen. First I created three groups of ":root" variables containing font sizes in the CSS file, one for large font sizes, one for small font sizes and one that is used to style all the text. I then created a Javascript function that added Event Listeners to the two font size Chatbot buttons. When the user clicks one of these buttons, the Event Listeners would override the set of CSS variables used to style the text with either the normal font sizes, or the larger font sizes - depending on which button the user pressed. This would then change the size of all the text on the screen. <br><br>

        This might be used by someone who struggles to read smaller sized text.<br><br>

    2. I integrated the option to change the screens colour scheme to a "Dark Mode". Essentially I did this in the same way as the font size changing, by using three groups of RGB varaibles, one for light mode, one for dark mode, and one that was used to style the page. A Javascript function adds an Event Listener to the two light mode buttons, Light and Dark. When the Dark Mode button is pressed, the function overrides the RGB values of the variables used to style the page with the "Dark Mode" values, which directly changing the colour scheme of the page.<br><br>

        This might be used by someone with eyes that are sensitive to extremely bright screens, or someone that is browsing the website in a dark area - to lighten the load on their eyes.<br><br>

    3. I added alt attributes to all my images, so that when a screen reader is used, it will be able to explain the content being presented by the images.<br><br>

        This might be used by someone with visual impairments.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Usability : </h2><br><br>

<p>
    Usability of a website is essential for the user's experience. If a website is difficult to use, it is likely that the user will have an upleasant experience and not recommend the website to any of their friends/colleagues. <br><br>

    1. I kept the layout of my website clear by evenly spacing all the elements and refrained from overpopulating the screen. The pages are organized and easy to navigate, and the points of interest on each specific webpage are distinct.<br><br>

    2. I kept the CSS colour scheme minimal. The main colours used are grey and blue - I find that they create a calm energy for the users to enjoy. Too many bright colours on a page can often overstimulate the user, or make it difficult to identify the vital information being presented on the page. <br><br>

    3. I kept the level of vocabulary quite simple so that the sites user can fully experience it regardless of their literate capabilities. My site is however limited to English, with a few Afrikaans tie-ins, and no option to translate it to another language. I feel, however, that this is appropriate, since the community is predominantly targeted at people who are local to South Africa.<br><br>

    4. I added an aspect of user-interaction to the website through my Chatbot. It can help users navigate the page, and provides them the ability to manipulate the page to their desire (font-size and colour-scheme). This prevents the user from feeling like they are being presented with a completely static piece of content.<br><br>

    5. I added provisions for people that use the website on other sized devices - like mobile and tablet - using media queries. When the user is using the website on a smaller device, the CSS of the page will automatically adapt to suite the size of the screen by changing font size and layout.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Learning : </h2><br><br>

<p>
    Learning how to manipulate DOM elements with Javascript was essential in my websites development. It allowed my website to be interactiv by adding functionality and usability, like font-size changing, colour-scheme changing. I achieved this through studying the coursework material. I also sought external information that was independant to the course and more specific to my needs.<br><br>

    Learning to implement Font Libraries was essential to the aesthetic tone of my website. Specifically, Font Awesome Library provided me with clear icons to use for my social media links and buttons. I achieved this by examining my mid-term assignment submission. For that submission, one of my teammates implemented Font Libraries - so I simply needed to examine the way in which he implemented it.<br><br>

    I found using Handlebars.js to have a steep learning curve. The coursework content provided an excellent base understanding, but I once again needed to seek external information for implementation that suited my specific needs. Once I successfully implemented the use of Handlebars.js templates, I made thorough use of it. Using templates also prevented me from having an excessively redundant code in my HTML files.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Evaluation I : </h2><br><br>

<p>
    There were some successful parts of my website which I am particularly proud of, for example - my Chatbot. The final version of the Chatbot worked exactly as it was intended to, and serves a great purpose in making my website unique. <br><br>

    My implementation of Handlebars.js was also successful, and provided a lot of room for scalability of the website in the future. When first introduced to the topic of templating, I thought to rather leave it out of my website due to my lack of understanding. During the design process, I realized that implementing handlebars.js was essential to to prevent redundant code and allow scalability. <br><br>

    Using @media queries to style the page according to screensize was also a new concept for me. I successfully implemented it, and can rest assured knowing that the I have accomodated more than just desktop users.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Evaluation II : </h2><br><br>

<p>
    I would have liked to add more dynamic animations to my website - like having images enlarge when hovered over. I feel it would have added a "premium" feel to the design of the website. <br><br>

    In my website's development, I first create each page for a Desktop-sized screen. Thereafter, I began development for the mobile and tablet versions. This became problematic because there were times that the mobile and tablet versions required a change in the structure of the HTML. Successfully implementing these changes often felt like playing a game of Jenga - one wrong move and the whole structure will come crashing down. In future, I will design the desktop, tablet and mobile versions simultaneously, so that if a change of structure is needed, it will be easy to implement.<br><br>
    
    When it comes to the website being bug-free, it is not. When changing the browser's window size, the media queries function properly and everything works fine. However, if you interact with the website (using the Chatbot options or clicking on the hamburger menu), and then change the window size - the Javascript functions override the CSS media queries, and can lead to the website behaving in a strange way. Fortunately, device screens are not known to suddenly change their size while being used. This is also something that I would improve on given the chance.<br><br>
    
    I also noticed that Firefox has problems displaying iFrames, so when viewing the website on Firefox, the iFrames in the join-us.html page does not display. This is something I would have liked to find a solution for in time for the deadline.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Resources :</h2><br><br>

<p>
    As previously mentioned, I made use of Font Libraries, both from Font Awesome Libraries and Google Fonts Libraries. <br><br>

    I used the Handlebars.js library to implement templating into the website, this allows for easy of use and less redundant code.<br><br>

    Within the faqs.html file, there is an animation of bouncing text. This animation requires a combination of both CSS and HTML that was used in my mid-term assignment. It was not origninally created by me, the original developer is unknown. I sourced it from the internet, and integrated it into my assignment.<br><br>

    As previously mentioned, the structure of my website was inspired by my mid-term assignment, specifically from Saad Koubeissi - a partner for the assignment. He created the mid-term websites CSS, header and footer. I learned a lot from analysing his work, it provided me with relevant conceptual understanding, like using variables in CSS. <br><br>
    
    To give credit where it is due, many of the screenshots used in my website were taken by members of the BraaiMasters community, and kindly donated to me for the purpose of this project - specifically by a member with the username "TheJourneyingValkyrie#4351".<br><br>

    <h2>Wire Frames and Mockups: </h2><br><br>
    <p>Note regarding the mockups: Due to the way in which I captured the mockups, the Chatbot floats around the center of the screen - where in reality is will always be around the bottom right of the screen. There was also an issue with capturing the Discord widget on the join-us.html page.</p><br><br>
