PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, HAS OF STATE AND DELEGATIONS, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ALLOW ME FIRST OF ALL TO CONGRATULATE HIS EXCELLENCY, MR. PETER THOMPSON, REPRESENTATIVE OF FIJI, ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE CURRENT GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND WISH HIM EVERY SUCCESS IN HIS MISSION. HE CAN REST ASSURE OF CHAD'S FULL SUPPORT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CONGRATULATE AND THANK HIS EXCELLENCY, OUTGOING PRESIDENT OF THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR HIS DEDICATION AND MANY INITIATIVES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE MOST DEMOCRATIC AND MOST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED NATIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, ON BEHALF OF CHAD AND THE AFRICAN UNION, I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE AND RENDER A HEARTFELT TRIBUTE TO HIS EXCELLENCY, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE MANDATE IS SOON COMING TO A CLOSE. HIS LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT AND TIRELESS INVESTMENT FOR 10 YEARS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO STRENGTHENING THE UNITED NATIONS AND PROMOTING HIS IDEALS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, FOUNDED MORE THAN 70 YEARS AGO BY 51 MEMBER STATE, THE UNITED NATIONS NOW HAS 193 MEMBER STATES, AND HAS EVOLVED TO MAKE OUR STATES ENTER CONNECTED AND INTER-DEPENDENT, JUST AS CHALLENGES HAVE BECOME GLOBAL AND COLLECTIVE IN NATURE. THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE IS FACING DIFFERENT TYPES OF THREATS THAT PROMPT GREAT CONCERN. ARMED CONFLICT, TERRORISM, CLIMATE CHANGE, LARGE-SCALE MIGRATION, UNDER DEVELOPMENT, POVERTY, ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND POLITICAL CRISES ARE TAKING ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. NO CONTINENT, NO REGION OF THE WORLD IS SPARED. CITIZENS OF THE WORLD FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE LIVING IN A CONSTANT STATE OF ANGUISH IN SOME CASES, DESPAIR IN OTHERS BECAUSE WAR, SENSELESS VIOLENCE AND EXTREME POVERTY AND THE ADVERSE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE PROLIFERATED IN THE HOPES OF RESOLVING THIS IS DIMINISHING. THE GROWING NUMBER OF REFUGEES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DISPLACED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. -- THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TAKING WITH THEM THOUSANDS OF LIVES. THE SYRIAN TRAGEDY THAT IS UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS NOW ARE AMONG OTHER CHALLENGES VERY TACTICAL ELEMENTS THAT SHOW A HOW POWERLESS WE ALL ARE. IN THE WORLD OF UNCERTAINTY, AFRICA IS THE CONTINENT THAT IS THE MOST VULNERABLE AND MOST EXPOSED. VICTIMS OF COLONIAL PLUNDERING, AND AT GRIPS WITH THE MANY PROBLEMS OF UNDER DEVELOPMENT. AFRICA TODAY IS BEARING THE FULL BREADTH OF TERRORISM, THE THREAT OF THE CENTURY. SOMALIA, LIBYA, MOLLY, THE LATE CHAD BASIN. THESE COUNTRIES AS A WHOLE ARE SERIOUSLY DESTABILIZED. THE AFRICAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES, DESPITE THE MODEST GAINS ARE ALL STRONGLY GALVANIZED AND COMMITTED TO FIGHT THIS ABSOLUTE EVIL. MOLLY, THE LATE CHADFOR EXAMPLE, THE GREAT SACRIFICES IN SOMALIA SINCE 2004. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE JOINT MULTINATIONAL FORCE BY THE STATES OF THE LATE CHAD BASIN TO FIGHT THE BOKO HARAM TERRORIST GROUP, AND THE CREATION OF THE GROUP THAT IS A FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY CORPORATION AND TO FIGHT THE CROSS-BORDER THREATS FACING THE COUNTRIES. IF THIS MOBILIZATION SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND SUPPORTED BY THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IN ALL OF ITS FORMS, WHETHER IT IS MATERIAL, FINANCIAL, MILITARY, OR THROUGH INFORMATION SHARING. I WOULD LIKE TO LAUNCH AN APPEAL FROM THIS PODIUM TO ALL OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE UNITED NATIONS, IN PARTICULAR, AFRICA'S PARTNERS TO PROVIDE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AFRICAN CAP -- COUNTERTERRORISM FUND ESTABLISHED LAST JULY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, AFRICA HAS ALSO MADE ENORMOUS EFFORTS TO MANAGE THE CRISIS AND CONFLICTS, WHICH IT IS EXPERIENCING BY EMPHASIZING THE PROMOTION OF THE REGIONAL CRISIS REVOLUTION APPROACH BY THE PEACE AND SECURITY ARCHITECTURE. THIS APPROACH, WHICH SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING AS THE CAPACITY OF INTERVENTION OF REGIONAL AND SEVERAL REGIONAL GIVEN GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY, AS WELL AS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERRITORY. AS WELL AS BEING OF DEPLOYMENT. THESE ARE ALL SPECIFIC EXAMPLES MADE BY THE AFRICAN UNION. THE COMPLEXITY OF COMPLEX AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THOSE IN AFRICA, IS SUCH THAT NO ORGANIZATION CAN RESOLVE THEM A LOAD. THAT IS WHY THE AFRICAN UNION HAS ALWAYS CALLED FOR A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED NATIONS TO TACKLE THE SECURITY THREATS ON THE CONTINENT. THEN DEPLOYING THE ABOVE MENTIONED. THE AFRICAN UNION HAS DONE SO ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHILE FULLY RESPECTING THE PREROGATIVES OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE AFRICAN UNION IS IN A POSITION TO COUNTER THE MULTIFACETED SUPPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS. WE WELCOME THE FACT THAT THE STRONG HEALTH POSITION OF THE AFRICAN UNION IS SHARED BY THE INTERDEPENDENT PANEL OF THE UNITED NATIONS WITH THE PEACE OPERATIONS 2015, WHICH HAS BEEN UNANIMOUSLY WELCOMED. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE AFRICAN UNION TAKING ON IT SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY. A DECISION AIMS AT GUARANTEEING 25% OF THE COST OF PEACE OPERATIONS AUTHORIZED AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON THE CONTINENT. IT HELPS TO OBTAIN THE REMAINING 75% FROM THE UNITED NATIONS WITH A PEACEKEEPING BUDGET AND SPIRIT AND SHARING OF EXPENSES. THE AFRICAN UNION IS THEREFORE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE BEGINNING OF FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL IN ORDER TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT COULD FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE EXEMPLARY PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE AFRICAN UNION AND THE UNITED NATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF PEACE, AND IN ORDER TO PROTECT CIVILIANS IN TIMES OF CRISIS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, THE POLITICAL AND SECURITY SITUATION IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES IS A RATE CONCERN TO ALL OF US. MALI CONTINUES TO BE THE SITE OF TARGETED ATTACKS BY TERRORIST GROUP, DESPITE U.N. FORCES ON THE GROUND, AS WELL AS AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED AFTER ARDUOUS NEGOTIATIONS IN ALGIERS. THE SITUATION WARRANTS A THOREAU ASSESSMENT BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH A VIEW TO PUTTING AN END TO THE CONFLICT AND DIALOGUE, AND ALSO WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE SPECIFIC AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO BE APPLIED TO THE TERRORIST THREATS. THE SITUATION IN LIBYA AND SOUTH SUDAN REMAINS DEEPLY DISTURBING AND REQUIRES GREATER MOBILIZATION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. WITH A STRONG INVOLVEMENT, AS WELL AS COORDINATION OF RECEPTIVE REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS . IN THIS RESPECT, A JOINT ACTION FIVE THE INTERNATIONAL UNION AND THAT OF THE UNITED NATIONS AIMED AT DEPLOYING A CIVILIAN PROTECTION FORCE OF 4000 TROOPS, IN ADDITION TO THE U.N. MISSION IN SOUTH SUDAN IS AN INITIATIVE TO BE WELCOMED. WE ALSO CALL FOR GREATER ACTION BETWEEN THE HIGH-LEVEL PANEL OF THE AFRICAN UNION OF SUDAN, AND THE UNITED NATIONS IN ORDER TO BRING THE PARTIES THAT HAVE THE SIGNED AGREEMENT TO DO SO. THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, DESPITE THE SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATION OF PRESIDENTIAL AND LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS, THE SITUATION REMAINS PRECARIOUS AND PROCEEDS TO THE MOST RECENT CLASHES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. THE SITUATION NEEDS A CONTINUOUS FOLLOW-UP. THE NEW CENTRAL GULF -- CENTRAL AFRICAN AUTHORITIES MUST BE SUPPORTED AT NORMALIZING RELATIONS OF THE COUNTRY. I CALL ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN FOR PEACE BUILDING, AS WELL AS NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. WE ALSO URGE THE CRITICAL PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY, AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT TO FAVOR DIALOGUE AND COORDINATION OF PRE-CRISES. THE AFRICAN UNION IS READY TO SUPPORT THEM IN RESOLVING DISPUTES BY PEACEFUL MEANS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, THE SERIOUS CRISES AFFECTING IRAQ, SYRIA, AND YEMEN SHOULD STIR OUR COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUS, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF DEAD AND WOUNDED FOR DISPLACED PERSONS AND REFUGEES, AS WELL AS THE DESTRUCTION OF VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST URGENTLY FIND A POLITICAL SITUATION -- SOLUTION TO THESE CRISES THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS FOR PARTIES AND CONFLICT. AS FOR THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, WE CALL FOR A DEFINITIVE AND EQUITABLE SOLUTION GUARANTEEING SECURITY FOR ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS, AND INDEPENDENCE AND VIABLE STATE. WAITING TO RESUME DIALOGUE. CLEARLY SETTING THE FRAMEWORK. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, AFRICA IS NOT ONLY A GIGANTIC RESERVOIR OF RAW MATERIALS, IT IS ALSO A LITTLE MORE THAN A BILLION MEN AND WOMEN YEARNING FOR HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT, ACCOMPANIED BY SOCIAL WEALTHY ELITE -- WELL-BEING AND PROSPERITY. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS CAPABLE OF ERADICATING POVERTY ON THE GROUND, AS LONG AS THEY UPHOLD COMMITMENTS TAKEN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH PUTS PEOPLE AT THE VERY CORE OF ALL CONCERNS. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGENDA SHOULD BE A PRIORITY TO ELIMINATE EXTREME PRIORITY TO FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE TO STRENGTHEN RESILIENCE. THIS WILL STRENGTHEN ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL. WE STRESS THE URGENCY NEED FOR EFFECTIVE MOBILIZATION OF RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY AND FINANCE DEVELOPMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACTION PLAN. BY ASSURING AN EFFECTIVE COORDINATION EFFORT, AS WELL AS CONSISTENCY. NO REGION IN THE WORLD, NO STATE CAN PROSPER ALONE SURROUNDED BY AN OCEAN OF DESTITUTION AND POVERTY WITHOUT UNDERGOING CONSEQUENCES. THE EXCESSIVE WAYS OF YOUNG MIGRANT WORKERS MOVING TOWARDS EUROPE, WHICH WE SEE ON THE DAILY BASIS, AND WHERE THOUSANDS HAVE DROWNED TO DEATH SHOULD CHALLENGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. WE CAN BUILD GHETTOS, MOBILIZE NAVAL FORCES TO CONTAIN THE MIGRANTS, BUT THE PHENOMENON WILL NOT STOP. THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE WILL BE GIVEN TO THE PROBLEM. THIS SEEMS TO UNFORTUNATELY FALL WELL BELOW EXPECTATIONS. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF PROVIDING CHARITY TO AFRICA, BUT RATHER, ESTABLISHING A TRUE MISTRESS SHE JERKED PARTNERSHIP TO TACKLE GLOBAL CHALLENGES. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO BEGIN COLLECTIVE AND CONCERTED ACTION, TAKING ON BOARD THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OF ALL THE PARTY CONCERNS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR AFRICA IS TIME IT CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENT ISSUES. THE EVENTS OF THE DESERT, AS WELL AS THE EL NINO PHENOMENON IN SOUTHERN AFRICA HEIGHTENED DEFORESTATION. THESE ARE ALL FRIGHTENING SIGNS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AFRICA. LAKE CHAD. WHICH MEASURED 25 THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETERS IN 1960 NOW REDUCED TO LESS THAN 2500 SQUARE KILOMETERS. PROOF OF THE DEGRADATION OF THE CLIMATE ON OUR CONTINENT. THIS DISASTER, WHICH IS DANGER IN COKE ASSISTANCE AMONG COMMUNITIES WILL CERTAINLY HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF THE REGION. OURTHE PARTNERSHIP WITH AFRICA MUST ALSO BE SEEN FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE CONTINENT, WHICH IS SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED. THIS HAS ESTABLISHED A NEW OBLIGATION AND FRAMEWORK FOR THE LONG-TERM FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. THERE IS STILL A GREAT DEAL LEFT TO BE DONE TO CARRY OUT ACHIEVEMENTS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS TAKEN ON BY ALL PARTIES ACCORDING TO DIFFERENTIATED RESPONSIBILITY. THIS AGREEMENT WILL ONLY BE CREDIBLE IF IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIFIC ACTION AIMED AT BRIDGING THE ALARMIST CAP AND THE NOBLE OBJECTIVES. THIS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN COPENHAGEN, MOBILIZING 20 MILLION -- $28 MILLION FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, THE SECURITY COUNCIL REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR AFRICA, WHICH BECAUSE OF AN INJUSTICE OF HISTORY REMAINS. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS REFORM THAT THE AFRICAN UNION HAS CALLED FOR FOR YEARS DOES NOT SEEM TO PROMPT ANY INTEREST. UNLESS AFRICA WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE ORGANIZATION, WHILE REAFFIRMING THE POSITION ON THIS MATTER, SUCH AS EXPRESSED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CONFIDENCE AND HOPE IN THE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS THAT THE U.N. INSPIRES WILL ONLY BE WELL-FOUNDED IF ALL NATIONS TAKE PART IN THEIR DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. ALL OF US MUST BE FAITHFUL TO HUMANKIND FOR BETTER AND WORSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. [APPLAUSE] >>
